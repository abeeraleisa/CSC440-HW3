<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--Here's a worked example of HTML and CSS from Lab 1!
	HTML consists of a hierarchy of elements.
	
	Each element has an opening tag and (most of the time) a closing tag.
	For example, the whole document is enclosed in the html element, delimited by the <html> and </html> tags.
	You can also close tags immediately using a slash before the > symbol: A newline is represented by <br />.

	Each tag can have attributes set as name="value" pairs.
	For example, the image element needs a source URL for the image file: <img src="dog.jpg" />

		<p>Hi, I'm Rex. I'm a dog in the League Baseball team, before I was sent to the Isle of Dogs. I was one of the five alpha dogs who helps Atari Kobiyashi look for his dog Spot. Later, I finally returned home to my owner Wes Anderson! Now I'm interested in the concept of UI designs and human computer interaction HCI and this is my first web page!
